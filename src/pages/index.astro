          Documentation built by MSPs,<br />
          not product managers.
        </h1>

        <p>
          Dokumint is a modern MSP documentation system designed around how
          technicians actually work — not how vendors want to sell.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- WHY -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Dokumint exists</h2>

        <p>
          Most documentation platforms grew by bolting features onto an old core.
          Permissions came later. Structure came later. Multi-tenancy came even
          later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dokumint started clean. Tenants, roles, permissions, and data boundaries
          were treated as first-class concerns from day one.

        <ul>
          <li>Proper multi-tenancy (not an afterthought)</li>

      <!-- STAND APART -->
      <section>
        <h2>Designed around reality</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Assets aren’t flat notes — they’re structured, queryable, and typed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Passwords can live where they make sense, not just in a disconnected
            vault.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tenants, customers, and technicians are cleanly separated by design.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- STATUS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Status</h2>

        <p>
          Dokumint is actively developed and used in real MSP environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re not chasing feature parity for the sake of it. We’re building what
          actually gets used.
